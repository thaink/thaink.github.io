In this posts, I will list some notes that I think they worth to be reminded when mentioning about classes's declaration, constructor and destructor.
 
##### In-class member function is inline function


2. default argument or initializers to data members

3. explicit constructor
Declare a constructor that can be called with a single argument explicit

4. initializer list to mprove performance

5. Zero-base rule

6. virtual destructor

7. Initializer-List Constructors

8. Remember to copy the bases
